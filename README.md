   Block Dude is a classic puzzle game originally released for the TI-83 graphing calculator in 1994. The objective of the game is to navigate a character named Block      Dude through a series of increasingly difficult rooms by moving blocks and climbing ladders.

   The game consists of 11 levels, each with multiple rooms. In each room, the player must move blocks around to create a path for Block Dude to reach the exit. Block      Dude can push and pull blocks, as well as climb ladders and jump from certain heights.

   As the game progresses, new challenges are introduced, such as enemies that must be avoided or defeated, switches that activate doors or move blocks, and blocks with    special properties, such as being immune to gravity or explosive.

   The game's simple yet challenging gameplay and clever level design made it a hit among TI-83 users and it has since been ported to various other platforms, including    mobile devices and web browsers.
